To create a comprehensive Source Code Review Guide in Confluence for developers and reviewers, you can structure the page with clear sections, best practices, and checklists to ensure that all necessary details are covered. Here’s a recommended outline and content structure for the guide:

Source Code Review Guide

1. Introduction

	•	Purpose of the Guide: Briefly explain why code reviews are essential and what the guide aims to achieve. This could include improving code quality, ensuring security, and promoting best practices.
	•	Audience: Specify that the guide is intended for both developers preparing their code for review and reviewers conducting the review.

2. Code Review Workflow

	•	Overview of the Review Process: Describe the end-to-end workflow, from code submission to review and approval. Include:
	•	When a code review should be requested.
	•	Typical timeline and expectations for a review.
	•	Roles and Responsibilities: Define the responsibilities of:
	•	Developer: Preparing code, writing tests, and addressing reviewer feedback.
	•	Reviewer: Checking code quality, functionality, security, and giving constructive feedback.
	•	Review Tools and Setup: Detail any tools the team uses for code reviews (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) and how to access or use these tools within the team’s workflow.

3. Pre-Submission Checklist for Developers

Include a checklist of tasks developers should complete before submitting their code for review. Some points to cover:

	•	Self-Review: Conduct a personal code review to catch obvious errors and improve readability.
	•	Linting and Formatting: Run automated linting and formatting tools.
	•	Unit Tests: Verify that all unit tests pass, and new functionality is thoroughly tested.
	•	Documentation: Ensure all new code is well-documented, with comments for complex logic and any necessary API documentation.

	Tip: You might include sample commands or specific linting rules the team uses.

4. Source Code Review Checklist

Provide a structured checklist that reviewers can follow to assess different aspects of the code. Organize the checklist with subsections for each main area:

	•	General Code Quality
	•	Code readability and naming conventions.
	•	Consistent formatting and indentation.
	•	Avoidance of hardcoded values; using environment variables or configuration files.
	•	Functionality
	•	Correctness and adherence to requirements.
	•	Edge cases and error handling.
	•	Logging without exposing sensitive information.
	•	Code Structure and Design
	•	Modular code with single responsibility for each function or class.
	•	Reusability and avoidance of duplicate code.
	•	Efficient algorithm choices and data structures.
	•	Security Considerations
	•	Input validation and sanitization.
	•	Dependency checks for vulnerabilities.
	•	Secure handling of sensitive data.
	•	Performance Optimization
	•	Efficient use of resources (memory, CPU, etc.).
	•	Asynchronous operations and optimized database queries.
	•	Testing
	•	Adequate unit test coverage.
	•	Tests for edge cases and isolated tests.
	•	Use of mocks or stubs for external dependencies.
	•	Documentation and Comments
	•	Comments explaining complex sections.
	•	API documentation for exposed endpoints.
	•	Updated setup or deployment guides, if applicable.

5. Best Practices for Developers

	•	Coding Standards: Link or outline the team’s coding standards (e.g., naming conventions, commenting style, file organization).
	•	Code Modularity and Reusability: Describe best practices for writing modular, reusable code.
	•	Error Handling and Logging: Provide guidelines for consistent error handling and logging across the codebase.

	Examples: Include code examples demonstrating best practices for readability, error handling, and modularity.

6. Best Practices for Reviewers

	•	Conducting Effective Reviews: Provide tips for conducting efficient, respectful, and thorough reviews.
	•	Constructive Feedback: Encourage constructive feedback with specific examples. For example:
	•	Instead of “This code is confusing,” suggest “Consider refactoring this function into smaller parts for readability.”
	•	Common Pitfalls to Avoid: Outline common mistakes that reviewers should be mindful of, such as excessive nitpicking on style or failing to check for test coverage.

7. Handling Review Feedback

	•	Addressing Feedback for Developers: Tips on how developers should address feedback and re-submit code.
	•	Communicating with Reviewers: Encourage open communication if clarifications are needed. For instance, developers can ask reviewers for clarification on suggested changes if necessary.
	•	Updating Pull Requests: Steps on how to update and resubmit code based on reviewer feedback.

8. Documentation and Resources

	•	Coding Standards Document: Link to your team’s coding standards document, if it’s separate from this guide.
	•	Tool Documentation: Include links to documentation for any tools used in the code review process.
	•	Training and Learning Resources: Provide links to resources for learning more about code review best practices or specific skills (e.g., secure coding practices).

9. Code Review Examples and Case Studies

	•	Good Code Review Example: Show an example of a well-done review with detailed feedback and appropriate responses.
	•	Common Issues and Fixes: List common issues encountered in code reviews and examples of how to address them.

10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

	•	Why do we do code reviews?
	•	What if I disagree with the reviewer’s comments?
	•	How much time should I spend on a code review?
	•	Provide answers to these common questions and any others the team might have.

Additional Tips:

	•	Use Formatting: Use bold for emphasis, bullet points for lists, and headings for each section to make the guide easy to scan.
	•	Add Visuals: Screenshots or flow diagrams for complex workflows can be very helpful.
	•	Link Other Pages: Link to any relevant Confluence pages, such as coding standards, tool setup guides, or API documentation.

If you’d prefer a textual flow instead of an image, here’s the detailed step-by-step flow for the source code review process before promoting code to UAT:

Source Code Review Process for UAT Promotion

	1.	Developer Completes Pre-Submission Checklist
	•	Developer checks for code quality, formatting, documentation, and testing.
	•	Ensures the code meets project standards and has sufficient test coverage.
	2.	Developer Submits Code for Review
	•	Code is submitted via a pull request or similar platform for review.
	3.	Reviewer Assignment
	•	A reviewer or review team is assigned based on expertise and availability.
	4.	Review Steps
	•	Functionality and Code Quality Check: Reviewer ensures the code meets functional requirements, is well-structured, and follows design principles.
	•	Security Check: Reviewer verifies input validation, data handling, and dependency security.
	•	Performance Optimization Check: Reviewer assesses resource usage, async processing, and optimizes database queries.
	•	Testing Coverage Check: Reviewer confirms unit tests cover key functionality, edge cases, and error handling.
	5.	Reviewer Provides Feedback
	•	Reviewer provides specific, constructive feedback, highlighting areas of improvement.
	6.	Developer Addresses Feedback
	•	Developer makes necessary changes based on the feedback and resubmits the code.
	7.	Reviewer Verifies Updates
	•	Reviewer checks the updated code to ensure all issues are resolved.
	•	If satisfied, reviewer marks the code as ‘approved.’
	8.	Approval for UAT Promotion
	•	Approved code is tagged, documented, and promoted to the UAT environment.

This flow keeps both developers and reviewers aligned, ensuring that code meets quality, security, and performance standards before it’s promoted to UAT. Let me know if you’d like further customization on this structure.

By creating this structured guide, you’ll provide both developers and reviewers with a comprehensive resource to support consistent, high-quality code reviews. This approach will help everyone follow best practices, maintain standards, and improve collaboration within the team.
